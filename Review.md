# Review

DDPG is implemented correctly. However, you can still modify the network architecture and hyperparameters for better performance. I am including the DDPG paper below, please go through it. You can follow the network architecture and hyperparameters similar to DDPG paper and compare the performance.

Since you have completed the project, now I would highly recommend the following things to work on.

Learn about the [parameter-noise](https://openai.com/blog/better-exploration-with-parameter-noise/), which is really effective and help in better exploration.
[Learning Dexterity](https://openai.com/blog/learning-dexterity/) shows the technique to control human-hand like robot to manipulate physical objects.
I would advise you to go through [Deep Reinforcement Learning for Self Driving Car](https://youtu.be/MQ6pP65o7OM) by MIT. So that you can know more about reinforcement learning algorithms in a broader and real-world perspective.
